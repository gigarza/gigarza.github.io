                            <p>To The Beat is a web application that will make the ideal playlist for your runs, workouts, or even jams.</p>
                            <p>The front-end of this website was made with Bootstrap, CSS, and Spotify logos provided by Font-Awesome. The backend is generated by python/flask and javascript.</p>
                           <p>When the user first enters the application, they will click to log-in to Spotify which prompts Spotify API calls to authorize that user's account to be used. Once
                               the account has been authorized with OAuth, the backend will receive the access token and the ID for the Spotify user.</p>
                           <p>Once redirected to the next page, the user will be prompted to enter their selections for the name and tempo they want for their new playlist. The backend will then
                               consistently update what the user has typed. There is also a sound button on the page which plays a single beat at the speed they have entered. This is done by calculating
                               how many milliseconds would be between each beat, then playing a simple single beat mp3 file.</p>
                           <p>Once the user clicks submit to enter their choices, the backend of the code then grabs the information from the user. It then makes Spotify API calls to first get all
                               of the user's faved songs. Using the Spotify ID of each of these songs, it then makes another Spotify API call to get the track info, which has the tempo of the song. This
                            tempo is then compared against the user's requested tempo, and if it is within 3BPM of the request, it is added to a list of songs for the new playlist.</p>
                           <p>Once the user's songs have been analyzed to find the ones which match tempo, a Spotify API call is made to create a new playlist with the name the user chose. The list of songs is
                           then added into this new playlist. Lastly, the user is redirected to a result page where details about their new playlist are listed, and the playlist itself is embedded into the page.</p>

                           <p>This webapp acts as a way to represent various data about San Francisco Dispatches. The data was received through csv files, then
                           input into a MongoDB database through a python backend file. Bootstrap/Bootswatch was used throughout the webapp to assist in frontend styling.</p>
                           <p>When the user first comes upon the site, they will hit the homepage, made solely through static html/css files. From this homepage, the
                           user can then get to any other page on the webapp.</p>
                           <p>The first page they can go to is the Statistics & Graphs page. On this page, the user can find various graphs and facts about the data. The
                           page itself was created using html/css files, but also an integration of Chartist.js to represent the data graphically. The data is
                            connected into these files by looking for and grabbing the necessary information from the database in the main python file.</p>
                           <p>Informational Maps is the second page a user can choose to go to. The user has the option to checkout 4 different maps on this page for
                           more visual information about the dispatch data. The first graph shows the zipcodes within San Francisco which seem to take the longest time
                           to dispatch. The Heat Map shows the user the frequency of dispatch calls across the city. The third map shows the user which are considered the
                           safest neighborhoods in the city (in relation to crime and dispatch call frequency). The final map then shows the zipcodes which have the highest
                           increasing rate of dispatch calls. All of the information for these maps was figured out algorithmically through a python backend along with get
                            requests on the database. The maps were then represented by using the Google Maps API and GeoJSON files.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, a user can look at the Most Likely Dispatch page, which will show them the dispatch that is most likely to occur based on
                           a location and time. The time input was integrated using TimePicker for jQuery, while the map and the marker drop were integrated using the
                           Google Maps API. After the user has clicked submit, an algorithm begins to discover what range of time and what areas to grab data from. From there,
                           the new list is gone through to find which type of dispatch call will be most likely, and outputs this result to the user.</p>

              but with the help of Bootstrap/Bootswatch and FontAwesome for some front-end styling. Most of the pages for the webapp can be accessed
                  from the homepage or from the navigation bar located at the top of all the other pages. Some noteable UI portions of this webapp are the
              modals for each project in the CS projects page (like the one you're on), the carousel for the dance gallery, and the dropdown menus throughout.
              The various pages on the site are updated to show the most recent information. Although the site is not yet suitable for a mobile screen,
                  I am hoping to attack that possibility next. Interested to look at the html or css code? Checkout the button to the github!</p>

                  the minimally functioning thread system. To do this, the sleep timer function was improved as to not busy wait,
                  implemented priority scheduling, and finally priority donation to prevent threads from forever holding onto
                  locks while they are low in the ready list. The second project focused entirely on allowing the Operating System to be
                  fully functional with user programs. This required an implementation of argument passing on the stack and system calls. Improvement

              <p>Completed while taking the Data Structures course at UT. This project's focus was to create a way to compress files, decompress the
                  resulting files, and then analyze the compression rates to maximize the efficiency.</p>
              <p>To begin compressing a file, the file is parsed through
              byte by byte and a map is created to account for the frequencies of all the different characters within the file. An eof is also added into
              this map. A priority queue of tree nodes is then created based on the frequencies of the characters. This priority queue is then passed into a
                  function which creates a tree based off of it. For the tree, a new parent node is created with children which are two elements which are
                  dequeued. This is done until there is only one node left in the queue, which will be the root of the tree. A map of codes is then created
              based off the tree, where a 0 indicates a shift left and a 1 indicates a shift right until an entire path is created. Lastly, a header is created
              which stores the information of the tree format. Finally a new file is created and the header data is written and then the compressed data is written
              according to the codes which were created.</p>
              <p>To being decompressing a file, the header data is the first thing to be decompressed. The header data will reveal the frequency of the characters
              so a frequency map can then be created. Similarly to compressing a file, a priority queue based on this is then created in order to create a tree. From
              this tree, we can generate codes which should match the codes created during compression. With this, we can then go through the compressed data, and with
              those codes, go through our newly created tree to figure out which characters correspond. From here, the file has been fully decompressed.</p>
              <p>For the project, different files were then fed into the program to analyze different compress/decompress rates based on the size of files. It
              turns out this program works best on larger files where there is higher frequency of characters.</p>

                               to recognize a user's location and search for the top 10 closest retail stores. After the user has chosen a location, they place the
                          barcode of their item under the camera. The program then scans the barcode, finds the product, and adds to the cart. The scanner itself was integrated

                               the item that matches it. This item is then added into a list that represents the user's cart. Once the user is ready to complete their purchase, they can click checkout.</p>

              <p>Created at the 2018 CDK Global Annual Hackathon, CapGen is an API in which a user can input a car's vin number, and receive an automatically
                  generated description for the vehicle. For the hackathon, the project was presented on a UI, built in Angular, to simply demo the program's capabilities. It was
              imagined that if this were to go to production for the company, it would simply act as an API for clients that wouldn't have such a structured UI.
              The API itself was deployed using Docker, and was set to be as production ready as possible.</p>
              <img style="height: 220px; margin: 0 auto; display: block" src="static/images/capgen_flow.jpg">
              <p style="margin-top: 16px">For the backend of the project, two separate models were trained in order to produce the descriptions. The model
              for the images was created using Keras' built in VGG model in order to extract features from the photo as a way to encode the images. For training, the correlated
              descriptions were tokenized and then the inputs and outputs were encoded in order to be prepared for the model. The model itself was then built in such a way that there
              were 3 portions: a photo feature extractor, a sequence processor, and a decoder. The model was then trained and fit using data provided by CDK global on AWS, and saved. This model is
              what predicts and generates the descriptions of the vehicles.</p>
              <p>When presented, the UI has a user input a vehicle's unique vin number, which our API then calls a CDK Vin Decoder API in order to gather images and features of
                  the specific vehicle to send to the backend. In the backend a function is called which sends this information to the pre-saved model and spits out the generated
              description. The UI then transitions to a results page where the image, features, and newly created description are displayed to the user.</p>
              <p>At the time of the hackathon demonstration only the model for the images was being used, as the feature model portion was still being trained and developed.
                  As this was a project done while working at CDK Global as an intern, no code is available to be seen. However, if you would like to find out
                  more, please feel free to contact me by heading over to the 'Contact' page on this website.</p>
